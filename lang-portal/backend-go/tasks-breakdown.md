## Out of Scope Items

The following features and implementations have been explicitly marked as out of scope for the current phase of development:

### Authentication System
**Original Scope:**
- User authentication implementation
- Authorization middleware
- Token management system
- User registration and login flows
- Password hashing and security
- Refresh token mechanisms

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- Authentication requirements not finalized for current phase
- May be implemented in future phases based on business needs
