## Executive Summary

The architecture represents a language learning platform that leverages GenAI capabilities for sentence construction and learning activities. The system is designed with three main components: Frontend Language Portal, Backend API, and GenAI systems, providing a scalable and modular approach to language learning.

## Functional Requirements

* Support multiple learning activities including sentence construction and vocabulary building
* Enable teacher administration and content management capabilities
* Provide vectorized knowledge base for enhanced learning responses
* Implement guardrails for both input and output of GenAI interactions
* Support vocabulary loading and management
* Enable progress tracking for learning activities

## Assumptions

* The system requires internet connectivity for GenAI operations
* Users (students/teachers) have basic digital literacy
* The system does not support multiple users and multiple tenants.
* We are going to use a SQL Database that will be used for both application database and Vector database.
* LLMs are accessible via API endpoints for both embedding and generation
* Sufficient computing resources are available for vector operations.
* Students learning Itallian language. Others are not supported.

## Data Strategy

### Data Types

1. Structured Data:
   * User profiles (students/teachers)
   * Vocabulary database
   * Learning activity progress
   * Vector embeddings

2. Unstructured Data:
   * Knowledge base content
   * Generated responses
   * Example Sentence constructions, etc

### Data Flow

1. Input Processing:
   * Students starts a sentence constructor activities by providing an initial sentence in english.
   * Backedn API receives the requests and gathers additional information from the SQL DB then fires a request to the LLM.
   * LLM generates clues, voccabulary, examples to help students to response the Italian transcription of the given sentence.
   * LLM verifies the student response and provide additional clue and finally provides the answer.
   * LLM Subsequently LLM continue on with another sentense based on the complexity level.

2. Storage:
   * Vector SQL DB for persistent storage
   * Vector Database for quick retrieval
   * Cache layer for frequently accessed content

## Technical Architecture

### Components Breakdown

1. Frontend Language Portal:
   * Sentence Constructor activity
   * Learning Activities (2 & 3)
   * Teacher administration interface

2. Backend API:
   * Vectorization service
   * Knowledge base management
   * Internal guardrails implementation
   * Activity progress tracking
   * Bridge between the application and LLMs

3. GenAI Systems:
   * LLM for embeddings
   * LLM for text generation
   * Guardrails tools integration

### Security & Governance

1. Access Control:
   * No authentication at this point in time

2. Data Protection:
   * Out of scope for now. 

## Monitoring & Performance

### Key Metrics

* Out of scope

### Scaling Considerations

* Out of scope

## Risk Mitigation

1. Technical Risks:
   - LLM availability: Implement fallback mechanisms
   - Vector database performance: Regular optimization
   - System latency: Caching strategy

2. Operational Risks:
   - Data consistency: Regular backups
   - System availability: Redundancy in critical components
   - Quality of responses: Continuous guardrail refinement

## Future Considerations

* Integration of additional learning activities
* Enhanced vectorization techniques
* Expanded knowledge base capabilities
* Advanced caching strategies
* Multi-language support
* Advanced analytics and reporting
